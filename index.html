            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Hi, my name is Rory and I am on a quest to become the best software engineer that I can be. On June 2020 I graduated from the University of Manchester with a 1st class MEng in Chemical Engineering. During my time at university I started to learn to code as a hobby in my spare time. The more I learnt about computer science and technology the more fascinated I became. The sense of achievement and enjoyment I got from improving my coding skills or from learning a new algorithm in order to solve a coding challenge was so unique that I had to learn more.
                </p>
                <p>While finding the time to learn and improve my coding skills was not always easy while studying a demanding degree like chemical engineering, I always ended up coming back to where I left off in my coding journey to improve existing skills and learn new ones. 
                </p>
                <p>During my final summer at university I had the opportunity to go and work in the IT department of BMW Group UK. While there I was able to develop applications and websites for the business. While receiving positive feedback for my work, I was able to learn and develop, so much from the programmers and software engineers there, for example I learnt a great deal about the role of testing in software engineering and how it is implemented into projects. I was also introduced to working in an Agile environment.
                </p>
                <p>Having finished university my ambition now is to find work in the tech industry as a software engineer. Every day I strive to learn more and improve, weather that is by learning new technologies, contributing to open source projects or working on my own projects, I see every day as an opportunity to learn, get better and achieve my dream career.  </p>

                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>I love designing and building websites. There is something unique about taking an idea from your head and seeing it come to life through code. I have developed websites as part of my work experience and through my own projects. I have worked with various frameworks and JavaScript libraries such as Angular and React. In any spare time I have, I am always trying to learn new CSS tricks or becoming a better JavaScript programmer.</p>

                    <h3>Decentralised Systems</h3>
                    <p>Since first hearing of blockchain technologies and decentralised applications (Dapps), I have been curious to see what all the hype was about. I started to learn the fundamentals of decentralised applications and the problems they can solve. I also started to learn to program in the Solidity, the most popular language for coding apps to deploy to the Ethereum blockchain. While I am still early in my learning of Dapps and blockchain technologies and still have much to learn I have found the journey so far to both challenging and fascinating.</p>

                    <h3>AI</h3>
                    <p>Machine learning is a fascinating topic, which has a wide range of applications from artificial intelligence to optimisation of chemical plants. The area of machine learning that interests me the most is reinforcement learning (RL). RL is the about training neural networks via trial and error to preform complex tasks. One the most well-known of applications of RL is Googleâ€™s AlphaGo, which used RL to learn to play the game of Go and beat the Go world champion. I have been using the resources on OpenAL to learn more about RL. While I still have a lot to learn, I am driven to learn more and excited about the ways that I could apply RL to my projects.         </p>
