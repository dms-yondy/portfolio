        <p>
          Hi, my name is Rory and I am on a quest to become the best software
          engineer that I can be. On June 2020 I graduated from the University
          of Manchester with a 1st class MEng in Chemical Engineering. During my
          time at university I started to learn to code as a hobby in my spare
          time. The more I learnt about computer science and technology the more
          fascinated I became. The sense of achievement and enjoyment I got from
          improving my coding skills or from learning a new algorithm in order
          to solve a coding challenge was so unique that I had to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          While finding the time to learn and improve my coding skills was not
          always easy while studying a demanding degree like chemical
          engineering, I always ended up coming back to where I left off in my
          coding journey to improve existing skills and learn new ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my final summer at university I had the opportunity to go and
          work in the IT department of BMW Group UK. While there I was able to
          develop applications and websites for the business. While receiving
          positive feedback for my work, I was able to learn and develop, so
          much from the programmers and software engineers there, for example I
          learnt a great deal about the role of testing in software engineering
          and how it is implemented into projects. I was also introduced to
          working in an Agile environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having finished university my ambition now is to find work in the tech
          industry as a software engineer. Every day I strive to learn more and
          improve, weather that is by learning new technologies, contributing to
          open source projects or working on my own projects, I see every day as
          an opportunity to learn, get better and achieve my dream career.
